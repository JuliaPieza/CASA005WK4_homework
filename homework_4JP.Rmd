## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

library(sf)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(janitor)

#Join the global gender inequality index to spatial data of the World, creating a new column of difference in inequality between 2010 and 2019.And then share to GitHub

#read in data csv and geojson

```
```{r}
#Read in data 
here::here()
gii_data <- read_csv(here::here("data", "GII_data.csv"))
world_shp <- st_read("data/World_Countries_(Generalized)_9029012925078512962.geojson")

```
```{r}
#cleaning and filtering the GII data
#new table with just iso, country, gii_2010, gii_2019
#calculate difference between 2010 and 2019
#then join to spatial file using country or iso

gii_table <- gii_data %>%
  select(iso3, country, gii_2010, gii_2019) %>%
  mutate(diff_2010_2019 = gii_2019 - gii_2010) 

world_shp <- world_shp %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
  
gii_shp <- gii_table %>%
  left_join(world_shp, by = "country")
  
```

```{r}
#final table is gii_shp which is joined data by country


```
